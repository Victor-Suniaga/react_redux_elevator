This project was an idea it occured to me to test my knowledge of promises/store and so on, I did it on plain javascript instead of typescript since I didn't want to focus so much on the types. If you like to see a project wich handles typescript and testing in a good way, checkout react_redux on my repositories.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
